Nowadays, 4D-CTA is available as a non-invasive alternative to digital subtraction angiography (DSA), with reported high accuracy in the evaluation of cranial arteriovenous fistulas (AVF). Optimized processing of 4D-CTA is crucial, considering the large amount of data generated. We present a proof-of-concept study for color-mapping of 4D-CTA for the detection and classification of cranial AVFs.
