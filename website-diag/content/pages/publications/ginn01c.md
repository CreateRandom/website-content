The traditional chest radiograph is still ubiquitous in clinical practice, and will likely remain so for quite some time. Yet, its interpretation is notoriously difficult. This explains the continued interest in computer-aided diagnosis for chest radiography. The purpose of this survey is to categorize and briefly review the literature on computer analysis of chest images, which comprises over 150 papers published in the last 30 years. Remaining challenges are indicated and some directions for future research are given.
