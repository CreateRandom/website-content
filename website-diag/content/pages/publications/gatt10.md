Intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS) is an image-guiding technique for cardiovascular diagnostic, providing cross-sectional images of vessels. During the acquisition, the catheter is pulled back (pullback) at a constant speed in order to acquire spatially subsequent images of the artery. However, during this procedure, the heart twist produces a swinging fluctuation of the probe position along the vessel axis. In this paper we propose a real-time gating algorithm based on the analysis of motion blur variations during the IVUS sequence. Quantitative tests performed on an in-vitro ground truth data base shown that our method is superior to state of the art algorithms both in computational speed and accuracy.
