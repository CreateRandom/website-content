A novel 2D slice based fully automatic method for model based segmentation of the outer vessel wall of the common carotid artery in CTA data set is introduced. The method utilizes a lumen segmentation and AdaBoost, a fast and robust machine learning algorithm, to initially classify (mark) regions outside and inside the vessel wall using the distance from the lumen and intensity profiles sampled radially from the gravity center of the lumen. A similar method using the distance from the lumen and the image intensity as features is used to classify calcium regions. Subsequently, an ellipse shaped deformable model is fitted to the classification result. The method achieves smaller detection error than the inter observer variability, and the method is robust against variation of the training data sets.
