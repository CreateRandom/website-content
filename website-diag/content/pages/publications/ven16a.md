Objectives To determine TRUS visibility of MR lesions.  Methods Data from 34 patients with 56 MR lesions and prostatectomy was used. Five observers localized and determined TRUS visibility during retrospective fusion. Visibility was correlated to PIRADS and Gleason scores.  Results TRUS visibility occurred in 43% of all MR lesions and 62% of PIRADS 5 lesions. Visible lesions had a significantly lower localization variability. On prostatectomy, 58% of the TRUS visible lesions had a Gleason 4 or 5 component.  Conclusions Almost half of the MR lesions were visible on TRUS. TRUS visible lesions were more aggressive than TRUS invisible lesions.
