Atherosclerosis is a vascular pathology affecting the arterial walls, generally located in specific vessel sites, such as bifurcations. In this paper, for the first time, a fully automatic approach for the detection of bifurcations in IVUS pullback sequences is presented. The method identifies the frames and the angular sectors in which a bifurcation is visible. This goal is achieved by applying a classifier to a set of textural features extracted from each image of an IVUS pullback. A comparison between two state-of-the-art classifiers is performed, AdaBoost and Random Forest. A cross-validation scheme is applied in order to evaluate the performances of the approaches. The obtained results are encouraging, showing a sensitivity of 75% and an accuracy of 94% by using the AdaBoost algorithm.
