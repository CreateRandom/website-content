The primary aim of the thesis was to develop automated systems for analysis of H&E stained breast histopathological images. This involved automatic detection of ductal carcinoma in-situ (DCIS), invasive, and metastatic breast cancer in whole-slide histopathological images. The secondary aim of the thesis was stated as:to identify new diagnostic bio-markers for the detection of invasive breast cancer in H&E stained breast histopathological images.
