This paper investigates the potential for automatic mapping of typical embedded applications to architectures with multimedia instruction set extensions. For this purpose a (pattern matching based) code transformation engine is used. The experiments show that about 85% of the loops which are suitable for Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) parallelization can be automatically recognized and mapped
