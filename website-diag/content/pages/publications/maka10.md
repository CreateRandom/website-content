In breast MRI, intensity inhomogeneity due to coil profile hampers development of robust segmentation and automated processing methods. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the performance in breast MRI of a number of existing non-uniformity correction methods, mostly developed for brain imaging, and a novel correction method first presented here. Ten breast MRI exams, which were manually segmented into background and five tissue classes, were used for performance assessment. Results show that the relatively simple and fast bias field correction method presented in this paper outperforms the other methods in a number of aspects.
