Glaucoma detection in color fundus images is a challenging task that requires expertise and years of practice. In this study we exploited the application of different Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) schemes to show the influence in the performance of relevant factors like the data set size, the architecture and the use of transfer learning vs newly defined architectures. We also compared the performance of the CNN based system with respect to human evaluators and explored the influence of the integration of images and data collected from the clinical history of the patients. We accomplished the best performance using a transfer learning scheme with VGG19 achieving an AUC of 0.94 with sensitivity and specificity ratios similar to the expert evaluators of the study. The experimental results using three different data sets with 2313 images indicate that this solution can be a valuable option for the design of a computer aid system for the detection of glaucoma in large-scale screening programs.
