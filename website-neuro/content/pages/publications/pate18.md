The assessment of the presence of intracranial hemorrhage is a crucial step in the work-up of patients requiring emergency care. Fast and accurate detection of intracranial hemorrhage can aid treating physicians by not only expediting and guiding diagnosis, but also supporting choices for secondary imaging, treatment and intervention. However, the automatic detection of intracranial hemorrhage is complicated by the variation in appearance on non-contrast CT images as a result of differences in etiology and location. We propose a method using a convolutional neural network (CNN) for the automatic detection of intracranial hemorrhage. The method is trained on a dataset comprised of cerebral CT studies for which the presence of hemorrhage has been labeled for each axial slice. A separate test dataset of 20 images is used for quantitative evaluation and shows a sensitivity of 0.87, specificity of 0.97 and accuracy of 0.95. The average processing time for a single three-dimensional (3D) CT volume was 2.7 seconds. The proposed method is capable of fast and automated detection of intracranial hemorrhages in non-contrast CT without being limited to a specific subtype of pathology.
