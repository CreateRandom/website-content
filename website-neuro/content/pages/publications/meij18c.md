PURPOSE Nowadays 4D-CTA is available as a non-invasive alternative to conventional angiography, with reported high diagnostic accuracy in the evaluation of different neurovascular disorders, including arteriovenous shunts and collateral flow pathways. Optimized processing of 4D-CTA is crucial, considering the large amount of data generated. Enhanced visualization of 4D-CTA can be achieved by applying color-mapping of temporal information in the cerebral vasculature.
