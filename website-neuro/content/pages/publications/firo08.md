PURPOSE Automated and accurate segmentation of intracranial aneurysms from Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) for characterizing aneurysm volume and shape RESULTS: The segmentation method successfully segmented the aneurysm and surrounding vasculature. The average surface distance between the method and the observers were 0.53Ã¯Â¿Â½0.19mm and 0.61Ã¯Â¿Â½0.22mm respectively, which was smaller than the interobserver average surface distance (0.95Ã¯Â¿Â½0.33mm). A pair T-test revealed that there was no significant difference in volume between the automatic segmentation and two observers (p=0.66, p=0.41). CONCLUSION: A method for semi-automated aneurysm segmentation has been presented which can replace manual segmentation.
