This paper describes the set-up of a segmentation competition for automatic and semi-automatic extraction of the liver from computed tomography scans and the caudate nucleus from brain MRI data. This competition was held in the form of a workshop at the 2007 Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention conference. The rationale for organizing the competition is discussed, the training and test data sets for both segmentation tasks are described and the scoring system used to evaluate the segmentation is presented.
