We analyze material properties underlying visual appearance, such as surface bidirectional reflection distribution function (BRDF) and texture. We perform gonioradiometric measurements on bricks and fit the data to sets of models of specular and diffuse reflectance on rough surfaces in order to describe the composite reflection mechanisms, of the surfaces under study. We also acquire images and perform image texture statistical discrimination techniques to determine the textural differences in the surface appearance, resulting from the variation of illumination and viewing.
