EMPIRE10 is a public platform for fair and meaningful comparison of registration algorithms which are applied to a database of intra-patient thoracic CT image pairs. Participants download 20 datasets from the internet, register them, and return the results for independent evaluation. Evaluation is carried out in four separate categories and participants are ranked according to their performance. All results are published on the EMPIRE10 website [1]. The Grand Challenge workshop at MICCAI 2010 [2] brings participants together to register a further 10 scan pairs live on site and for discussion and collaboration opportunities.
