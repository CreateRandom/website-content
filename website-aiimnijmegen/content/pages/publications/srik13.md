Detecting early stage breast cancers like Ductal Carcinoma In Situ (DCIS) is important, as it supports effective and minimally invasive treatments. Although Computer Aided Detection/Diagnosis (CADe/ CADx) systems have been successfully employed for highly malignant carcinomas, their performance on DCIS is inadequate. In this context, we propose a novel approach combining symmetry, kinetics and morphology that achieves superior performance. We base our work on contrast enhanced data of 18 pure DCIS cases with hand annotated lesions and 9 purely normal cases. The overall sensitivity and specificity of the system stood at 89\% each.
