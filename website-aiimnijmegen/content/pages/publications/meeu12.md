The purpose of this study was to evaluate two MR-guided biopsy techniques at 3 T, large core needle breast biopsy (LCNB) and vacuum-assisted breast biopsy (VAB) and to compare the diagnostic yield and rate of complications to determine the optimal biopsy technique at 3 T.55 LCNB and 64 VAB were consecutively performed. Benign biopsy results were verified by retrospective correlation of histology, with pre-interventional, post-interventional MRI studies and follow-up and were classified as representative or non-representative. Time to follow-up was up to 2 years for the considered non-representative benign lesions. Statistical analysis was performed using the Chi-squared test.LCNB was technically successful in 100\% of patients (55/55) and VAB in 98\% of patients (63/64). Histopathological analysis resulted in 45 (82\%) benign, 3 (5\%) high-risk and 7 (13\%) malignant lesions for LCNB and 43 (67\%) benign, 3 (5\%) high-risk and 18 (28\%) malignant lesions. Distribution was significantly different (p?<?0.001), favouring VAB over LCNB.Because of the substantially higher diagnostic yield and certainty of a benign diagnosis, VAB is the optimal biopsy technique at 3 T. LCNB should be considered when VAB is not feasible.
