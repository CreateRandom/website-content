Purpose Women at increased risk for breast cancer are screened with annual MRI and mammography. However, despite this intensive surveillance interval cancers still occur. The purpose of this study is to evaluate prognostic factors of interval carcinomas and compare these to prognostic factors of screen detected cancers. Methods and Materials: In a review of our intermediate and high risk screening program from 2003 to 2013, 170 cancers in 159 women were identified. Of these, 14 cancers were true interval carcinomas presenting with symptoms, and 132 were detected in screening. TwentyÃ¯Â¿Â½four further cancers were detected in prophylactic mastectomy specimens, and were excluded from this study. PatientÃ¯Â¿Â½ and cancer characteristics of screen detected cancers and interval cancers were compared using a Pearson's chiÃ¯Â¿Â½squared test for categorical variables and a Student's tÃ¯Â¿Â½test for continuous variables. Results: Interval cancers occurred in younger patients (p=0.001), had a higher pTÃ¯Â¿Â½stage (p=0.046), and were more often ERÃ¯Â¿Â½negative and PRÃ¯Â¿Â½negative (p=0.002, and p=0.002, respectively). Tumor grade appeared worse in interval carcinomas and were more often invasive, but this did not reach statistical significance (p=0.062, and p=0.063, respectively). HER2Ã¯Â¿Â½status was not significantly different. Fortunately, no difference was observed in pNÃ¯Â¿Â½stage or presence of metastatic disease. Conclusion: Interval cancers occurring in women participating in intensive surveillance programs are of more aggressive nature than screen detected cancers. However, our results suggest that interval cancers are detected when the disease is local. This still results in a relatively good prognosis for patients with interval cancer.
