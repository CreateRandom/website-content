Breast MRI is an indispensable modality in breast imaging with its high sensitivity for detecting breast cancers. Altough benign lesions also appear in breast MRI, it is possible to distinguish them from malignant lesions by interpreting them based on their morphology,contract-enhancement dynamics and other adjunct information such as their  diffusion properties imaged with DWI and their appearance on T2w images.
