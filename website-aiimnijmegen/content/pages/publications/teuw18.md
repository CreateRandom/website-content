A general method is presented for determining the maximum electric energy in a bounded region of optical fields with given time-averaged flux of electromagnetic energy. Time-harmonic fields are considered whose plane wave expansion consists of propagating plane waves only, i.e., evanescent waves are excluded. The bounded region can be quite general: it can consist of finitely many points, or be a curve, a curved surface or a bounded volume. The optimum optical field is eigenfield corresponding to the maximum eigenvalue of a compact linear integral operator which depends on the bounded region. It is explained how these optimum fields can be realized by focusing appropriate pupil fields. The special case that the region is a circular disc perpendicular to the direction of optical axis is investigated by numerical simulations.
