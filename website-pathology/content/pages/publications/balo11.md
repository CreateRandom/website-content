The assessment of arterial luminal area, performed by IVUS analysis, is a clinical index used to evaluate the degree of coronary artery disease. In this paper we propose a novel approach to automatically segment the vessel lumen, which combines model-based temporal information extracted from successive frames of the sequence, with spatial classification using the Growcut algorithm. The performance of the method is evaluated by an in vivo experiment on 300 IVUS frames. The automatic and manual segmentation performances in general vessel and stent frames are comparable. The average segmentation error in vessel, stent and bifurcation frames are 0.17 Ã‚Â± 0.08 mm, 0.18 Ã‚Â± 0.07 mm and 0.31 Ã‚Â± 0.12 mm respectively.
