Classification of detected pulmonary nodules is a key task in deciding the optimal follow-up strategy for patients in lung cancer screening. We propose a framework based on Convolutional Networks (ConvNets) to automatically assess nodule type for lesions detected in CT scans. The proposed ConvNet processes nodules in 3D scans through a combination of several 2D views and classifies it as solid, part-solid, non-solid and calcified. We validated the method on data from the lung cancer screening trials DLCST and MILD.
